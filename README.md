Hi, I am Anna Maniuk. I write Android applications.  I am based in Miami, FL, USA 🌴<br />
<br />
🦸‍♀️ About me:<br />
<ul>
  <li> I started off my engineering career as a web developer and have experience working with jQuery, React, Bootstrap,and NodeJs.</li>
  <li> I then developed a keen interest in the Android platform and Kotlin programming language.</li>
  <li> I believe that the Android arena has huge potential and the Android OS should run in every device with a touch screen. </li>
  <li> I have two real-word Android projects under my belt and I would like to do more. </li>
</ul>

📚 I attended [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in the Fall of 2021, where I  started developing [NeuroFit](https://github.com/saintmarina/alpha_training), an Android brainwave visualizer for the Open BCI brain EEG machine.<br />

🔨 I am currently working on [NeuroFit](https://github.com/saintmarina/alpha_training), because of my passion for psychology and mental health🧠<br />
