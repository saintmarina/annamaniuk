Hi, I am Anna Maniuk. I engineer applications for the Android platform.  I am based in Miami, FL, USA🌴

I started off my engineering career as a web developer and have experience working with jQuery, React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, NodeJs, and Python. After participating in an Android project, I developed a keen interest in the Android platform and Kotlin programming language. I believe that the Android arena has huge potential and I would like to participate in its advancement. I love working with Android Studio and am comfortable with the Android framework, Kotlin, and Java programming languages. 

📚 I attended [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in the Fall of 2021, where I focused on becoming a better programmer.

🔨 I am currently working on [NeuroFit](https://github.com/saintmarina/alpha_training), an Android brainwave visualizer for the Open BCI brain EEG machine, because of my recently discovered passion for neuroscience🧠
