Hi, I am Anna Steel. I **write Android applications**.  I am based in Miami, FL, USA 🌴<br />
💼 I am currently working as a **Senior Android Developer at Accenture**, specializing in building **native Android applications** and **Kotlin Multiplatform** solutions with **Jetpack Compose UI, Decompose navigation, and native SwiftUI**.<br />

<ul>
  <li> I started off my engineering career as a web developer and have experience working with jQuery, React, NodeJs and Cordova.</li>
  <li> I then developed a keen interest in the Android platform and the Kotlin programming language.</li>
  <li> I believe that the Android arena has huge potential and the Android OS should run on every device with a touch screen. </li>
  <li> I have three real-world Android projects under my belt and I would like to do more. </li>
</ul>

📚 I attended [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in the Fall of 2021, where I  started developing [NeuroFit](https://github.com/saintmarina/neurofit), an Android neurofeedback training app for the OpenBCI brain EEG machine.<br />

🔨 I am currently working on [NeuroFit](https://github.com/saintmarina/neurofit), because of my passion for psychology and mental health 🧠<br />
